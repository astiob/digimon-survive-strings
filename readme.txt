Digimon Survive text patch v0.2
(Containing things I've noticed during my first playthrough)

Installation
============

Copy and paste this into \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Digimon Survive\DigimonSurvive_Data\StreamingAssets\StandaloneWindows64

This will replace the two existing "en" files. If you want to get the originals back, delete them and have Steam verify the integrity of the game.


What happened?
==============

This game -- as is common in the industry -- was translated by multiple outside contractors who recieved various materials at various times. They had to perform guesswork on what a lot of what the dialogue was refering to, especially in cases of sentences unspecified objects that are common in Japanese. While they did the best they could with what they have, Bandai Namco skipped out on proper proofreading and editing after everything was compiled together. There were similar issues with their release of the final Super Robot Wars 30 DLC (which still haven't been resolved) that even mixed up two mission names. 

If you look closely, you can see how different people worked on different parts of the game. Some segments go through a lot more effort to avoid giving Digimon pronouns than others. It's possible the more troublesome segments (part 5) were finalized much closer to release.
